# @metaphorxyz/scaffold
This package includes automations for linting, formatting, and generating for Metaphor projects.

## Usage
At the moment, the package's main artifact is a drop-in replacement for `eslint` that includes Metaphor's universal linting and formatting configuration. Just install it into a project and run the `eslint` binary as usual and it will just work. No `.eslintrc.json` needed!

```shell
> npm i --save-dev @metaphorxyz/config

or

> yarn add -D @metaphorxyz/config
```
